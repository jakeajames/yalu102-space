If you are already on iOS 10.2 with an iPhone 7, **stay there**. The actual exploit behind this still works, but the KPP bypass does not.

3. Change the bundle ID, as shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/wiki/how-to-sideload#wiki_changing_the_bundle_identifier_and_team)
4. Include the IOKit headers, and add them to your search path.
